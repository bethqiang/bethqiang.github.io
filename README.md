# My Website & Blog

My site and my thoughts on life, code, and the pursuit of happiness.

Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Todo:

* This was written before I knew as much about accessibility, so need to do some sort of audit and fix all of the accessibility issues that I'm sure exist.
* I really don't love having an entirely separate styles folder; I'd like to co-locate them with the components/pages.
* I sort of confused myself with the structure of the components folder, so probably fixing that.
* Writing page: why is the date an h4?
* Probably a whole lot of other stuff that I haven't found yet.
