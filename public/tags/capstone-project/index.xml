&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. In the past couple of weeks, our project has gone from a scaffolded foundation to a thing with different rooms and avatar skins and couches, and it&amp;rsquo;s been really cool to see!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;logging-in&#34;&gt;Logging In&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things we did following &lt;a href=&#34;http://bethqiang.com/post/react-redux-race-conditions-webrtc/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt; was implement Login and OAuth. At one point, we were encountering a Sequelize race condition, where we couldn&amp;rsquo;t refer to the &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; model with its filepath; instead, we had to import it into our file using &lt;code&gt;const User = require(&#39;../db&#39;).model(&#39;users&#39;)&lt;/code&gt;. I also spent a good few hours being puzzled over the fact that, despite forming a one-to-one association, a &lt;code&gt;user_id&lt;/code&gt; field was only being put on the &lt;code&gt;session&lt;/code&gt; table, and a &lt;code&gt;session_id&lt;/code&gt; wasn&amp;rsquo;t being put on the &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; table. Silly me, &lt;code&gt;Session.belongsTo(User)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;User.hasOne(Session)&lt;/code&gt; will both put a &lt;code&gt;user_id&lt;/code&gt; field on the &lt;code&gt;session&lt;/code&gt; table. Definitely something I should have known, but at least I figured it out in the end?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had my first encounter with React inline styling while creating the Login component! I haven&amp;rsquo;t come to a firm conclusion on how I feel about it yet, but some part of me seems to prefer it. It seems&amp;hellip;like less mental overhead somehow. I &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; like the fact that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to use things like &lt;code&gt;:focus&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:hover&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:before&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;:after&lt;/code&gt;, which my initial styling had depended on. For the first two, I ended up installing Radium, which effectively replicated them. I also learned about syntax decorators, and sprinkled that into our Babel configuration. For the last two, I resorted to just creating two &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-chair&#34;&gt;THE CHAIR!!!!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my previous post, A-Frame and React don&amp;rsquo;t really like each other very much. They&amp;rsquo;re fundamentally built on different programming paradigms, and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of smaller issues that crop up (e.g. the words &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; are apparently React-specific words and we can&amp;rsquo;t use them as HTML attributes, or the fact that &lt;code&gt;a-sphere&lt;/code&gt;s will render fine, &lt;code&gt;a-cylinder&lt;/code&gt;s will render but throw wanrings, and &lt;code&gt;a-box&lt;/code&gt;es won&amp;rsquo;t render at all). Because of this, the moment we React-ified what we&amp;rsquo;ve now dubbed &amp;ldquo;the chair&amp;rdquo; was a pretty epic moment for us. It was the first time that it felt like A-Frame and React played nicely with each other!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A-Frame HTML, like normal HTML, will ignore things it doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand. Apparently, A-Frame HTML has no concept of a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, in order to render different elements, we had to wrap them in &lt;code&gt;a-entity&lt;/code&gt; tags. Creating a singular chair was mostly a matter of some basic shapes and positioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;export default (props) =&amp;gt; (
  &amp;lt;a-entity id=&amp;quot;chair&amp;quot; position={`${props.x} ${props.y} ${props.z}`} rotation=&amp;quot;0 180 0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;a-entity mixin=&amp;quot;chair-part&amp;quot;
              geometry=&amp;quot;height: 1; depth: 0.05; width: 0.05&amp;quot;
              position=&amp;quot;-0.25 0.5 0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a-entity&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;a-entity mixin=&amp;quot;chair-part&amp;quot;
              geometry=&amp;quot;height: 1; depth: 0.05; width: 0.05&amp;quot;
              position=&amp;quot;0.25 0.5 0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a-entity&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;a-entity mixin=&amp;quot;chair-part&amp;quot;
              geometry=&amp;quot;height: 0.5; depth: 0.05; width: 0.05&amp;quot;
              position=&amp;quot;-0.25 0.25 0.5&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a-entity&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;a-entity mixin=&amp;quot;chair-part&amp;quot;
              geometry=&amp;quot;height: 0.5; depth: 0.05; width: 0.05&amp;quot;
              position=&amp;quot;0.25 0.25 0.5&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a-entity&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;a-entity mixin=&amp;quot;chair-part&amp;quot;
              geometry=&amp;quot;height: 0.05; depth: 0.05; width: 0.55&amp;quot;
              position=&amp;quot;0 1 0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a-entity&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;a-entity material=&amp;quot;color: black&amp;quot;
              geometry=&amp;quot;primitive: box; depth: 0.55; height: 0.05; width: 0.55&amp;quot;
              position=&amp;quot;0 0.5 0.25&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a-entity&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/a-entity&amp;gt;
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If an entity is a child of another entity, the parent element takes on what is analogous to absolute positioning, and its child elements take on what is analogous to relative positioning with relation to its parent element.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had our singular React-ified chair, we passed in an array of positions. Each position was passed down to each chair via props. And voila, we had chairs on chairs on chairs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://bethqiang.com/images/posts/2017-02/the-chair-reactifying-aframe-entities.png&#34; class=&#34;center-img&#34; alt=&#34;The chair, a demonstration in React-ifying A-Frame Entities&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;link-traversal&#34;&gt;Link Traversal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on, it was always an idea that we&amp;rsquo;d have different rooms &amp;ldquo;branching off&amp;rdquo; of our main room, where people could go to have private conversations. Our initial idea was to have one scene with interconnecting rooms literally branching off of it; almost like a real building would. However, as time went on, we realized that it might be easier for us to program the switching of rooms if we just had one room per scene, and switched out the scenes when a user entered or left a room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the next natural step would be to figure out how to get a user from one scene to another. We started off with the idea of hyperlinks, where each hyperlink would render a different component that contained a full &lt;code&gt;a-scene&lt;/code&gt; and everything in it. But, once we implemented them, we realized that Chromium would knock us out of VR mode to traverse links, so that was a no-go. Mozilla has apparently worked out a fix for this, but because VR mode doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on the Daydream with Firefox Nightly, we had to find a different workaround.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we ended up with a single &lt;code&gt;a-scene&lt;/code&gt; tag in our main React component, and switching components wrapped in &lt;code&gt;a-entity&lt;/code&gt; tags in and out of it accordingly. It&amp;rsquo;s not the most ideal solution, but as of this point in time, there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a better way to accomplish this given the current state of the technology and Chrome&amp;rsquo;s security measures that prevent us from using a lot of WebVR APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our links take the form of fancy magical floating orbs that glow a certain shade of blue when you hover over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://bethqiang.com/images/posts/2017-02/aframe-hyperlink-orbs.png&#34; class=&#34;center-img&#34; alt=&#34;A-Frame Hyperlink Orbs&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming soon, to a blog near you: how a frog caused us a lot of mental anguish, how we solved (sort of) the teleportation/everything-else-is-eating-our-browser-resources problem, and how these two topics are very related.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Story of React, Redux, Race Conditions, and Real-Time Communication</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Most of our work on our Capstone project this past week has been trying to set up the base for what we&amp;rsquo;ll be building the super cool features off of. So far, I ported &lt;a href=&#34;http://bethqiang.com/post/how-to-develop-a-vr-app-prototype/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my prototype&lt;/a&gt; over, put React in, took React out, put React in again, put Redux and Immutable.js in, fixed race conditions (race conditions and I have grown a little too familiar with each other for my liking), and learned an important lesson about &lt;code&gt;querySelector&lt;/code&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve also attempted to aid in implementing WebRTC, which has turned out to be surprisingly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;react-and-a-frame&#34;&gt;React and A-Frame&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put React in initially because we thought it&amp;rsquo;d be a nice-to-have. Then we realized that, for our base MVP at least, we definitely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be using it to any meaningful degree. A-Frame and React also don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily always play nice with each other; A-Frame is an entity-component-system framework, which favors composability over inheritance. React, on the other hand, is based on inheritance. One of the reasons React is so performant is that it batches its updates; however, when we&amp;rsquo;re going for 60 or 90fps+ real-time rendering, that&amp;rsquo;s maybe not quite what we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, using React with A-Frame does have a few benefits. First, as long as we&amp;rsquo;re able to let A-Frame do the 3D and VR bits, React does a great job at what it was meant for: a view layer and managing state. Furthermore, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that wrapping React over three.js (our other possible option) results in a lot of performance issues, but A-Frame provides the much-needed bridge between the 3D/VR world and React, lessening that performance hit by a not insignificant amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ultimately decided that if we do want to have various views in the future (which ideally we will, at least on the desktop version), it&amp;rsquo;d be better to have React in from the start, rather than needing to go back later to finagle it back in and make it play nice with everything already there. We&amp;rsquo;ve been told in our initial code review that, despite having React in our app, (1) it&amp;rsquo;s very un-React like and we could probably do more React-ifying, which I definitely want to look into soon and (2) it almost resembles an Angular app, because it&amp;rsquo;s very event-based right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;redux-and-immutable-js&#34;&gt;Redux and Immutable.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I threw Redux into both ends as well, and converted our state to use Immutable.js. Using Redux on the back-end was an entirely new experience and it took an afternoon to go baby-step-by-baby-step to un-boggle my brain, but once I realized that it was &lt;em&gt;the exact same&lt;/em&gt; as Redux on the front-end — you dispatch an action, and your reducer changes the state based on that action — everything pretty much clicked afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was adding in Immutable.js, I learned an interesting tidbit: socket.io doesn&amp;rsquo;t really understand Immutable collections and ends up converting them to plain JavaScript structures when sending them across the Internet. We were exceptionally confused for a short period of time when our back-end was supposedly sending an Immutable Map and our front-end could access properties on it like it was a normal object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-race-condition&#34;&gt;Another Race Condition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;or-when-i-learn-that-getelementbyid-queryselector-true&#34;&gt;Or, when I learn that getElementById &amp;gt; querySelector === true&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had another race condition emerge that is strangely absent in my prototype. When a new user joined and there were existing users in the &amp;ldquo;room,&amp;rdquo; the back-end would sometimes start pushing this new user&amp;rsquo;s updates to the front-ends of everyone else before the new user had been able to be added to everyone else&amp;rsquo;s DOM. The &lt;code&gt;newUser&lt;/code&gt; function and the &lt;code&gt;updateUsers&lt;/code&gt; function were originally separate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;socket.on(&#39;newUser&#39;, user =&amp;gt; {
  console.log(&#39;Someone else has joined&#39;);
  putUserOnDOM(user);
});

socket.on(&#39;usersUpdated&#39;, users =&amp;gt; {
  console.log(&#39;Updating position for all users&#39;);
  Object.keys(users).forEach(user =&amp;gt; {
    const otherAvatar = document.querySelector(`#${users[user].id}`);
    otherAvatar.setAttribute(&#39;position&#39;, `${users[user].x} ${users[user].y} ${users[user].z}`);
    otherAvatar.setAttribute(&#39;rotation&#39;, `${users[user].xrot} ${users[user].yrot} ${users[user].zrot}`);
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get rid of the race condition that this caused, I ended up implementing a conditional statement — if the element didn&amp;rsquo;t exist on the DOM, add it. If it did, then update as normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;socket.on(&#39;usersUpdated&#39;, users =&amp;gt; {
  Object.keys(users).forEach(user =&amp;gt; {
    const otherAvatar = document.querySelector(`#${users[user].id}`);
    if (!otherAvatar) {
      putUserOnDOM(users[user]);
    } else {
      otherAvatar.setAttribute(&#39;position&#39;, `${users[user].x} ${users[user].y} ${users[user].z}`);
      otherAvatar.setAttribute(&#39;rotation&#39;, `${users[user].xrot} ${users[user].yrot} ${users[user].zrot}`);
    }
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after implementing this, we were having issues with the &lt;code&gt;querySelector&lt;/code&gt; — there seemed to be times that the &lt;code&gt;querySelector&lt;/code&gt; errored out, which prevented the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement from ever being executed, which means the user was never put on the DOM. As you can imagine, that&amp;rsquo;s a small problem. So, instead, I decided to use &lt;code&gt;getElementById&lt;/code&gt; (which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t tried in the first place because the majority of A-Frame examples I had seen used &lt;code&gt;querySelector&lt;/code&gt;). Since it was a guarantee that &lt;code&gt;getElementById&lt;/code&gt; would return &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; if the element didn&amp;rsquo;t exist, we could ensure that the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement would execute when it needed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I later discovered that in order to use &lt;code&gt;querySelector&lt;/code&gt; on IDs that are numbers, you sometimes &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20306204/using-queryselector-with-ids-that-are-numbers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;need to handle them in special ways&lt;/a&gt;. So, the reason it only sometimes freaked out on us was because our IDs were simply socket IDs, only some of them started with numbers. The more you know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-time-audio-communication&#34;&gt;Real-Time Audio Communication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done a lot of WebRTC outside of my initial research when putting together my prototype, I started helping one of my teammates implement WebRTC. He had gotten &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; close over the past few days, but still not quite there — two browsers were connected, but audio still wasn&amp;rsquo;t streaming from one to the other. We ended up attempting to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://simplewebrtc.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SimpleWebRTC library&lt;/a&gt;, which we knew &lt;em&gt;was physically possible&lt;/em&gt; to integrate with our socket structure, but something about it was just not happy with our sockets. So, we moved on to reimplementing from scratch. TBD on how that turns out, but fingers crossed!&lt;/p&gt;
