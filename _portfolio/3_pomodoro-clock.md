<p>A productivity app based on the Pomodoro Technique.</p>

<p>Built using HTML, CSS, <a href="http://materializecss.com/" target="_blank">the Materialize framework</a>, JavaScript, and JQuery.</p>

<p>Current functionalities include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Customize work, break, and extended break times.</li>
	<li>Sound alert when the current session starts and ends.</li>
	<li>Track the number of sessions that have been completed.</li>
	<li>After 4 "work" sessions, the clock will default to an extended break time instead of a normal break time.</li>
	<li>Pause current session or completely reset the app.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was an intentional design choice that the user must press the "start" button to start every session--the clock won't move on to the next session automatically. When the work session finishes, the user may need an extra minute or two to finish the immediate task at hand (and, for example, won't just stop in the middle of writing an email). Likewise, if the user leaves the computer during a break and the session finishes, the clock won't automatically start a work session.</p>
