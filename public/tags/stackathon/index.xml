      <title>How to Develop a VR App Prototype, in 26 Steps</title>
      <link>http://bethqiang.com/post/how-to-develop-a-vr-app-prototype/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://bethqiang.com/post/how-to-develop-a-vr-app-prototype/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Come up with an idea. &lt;a href=&#34;http://bethqiang.com/post/codsworth-robotics-stackathon-design-lecture/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Decide upon attempting to prototype a social VR app&lt;/a&gt; that would support many users, as there isn&amp;rsquo;t one that exists today that does so, and ideally (if time permits) implement real-time audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Notice that &lt;a href=&#34;https://aframe.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A-Frame&lt;/a&gt; is supposedly easy to get up-and-running. Do some digging into creating multiuser experiences in A-Frame. Discover that someone has created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/firebase&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Firebase component in A-Frame&lt;/a&gt;, making the multiuser part &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Implement A-Frame and the Firebase component according to the example. Render a scene where when a user hits the page, another &amp;ldquo;avatar&amp;rdquo; pops up! With head-tracking!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Realize that with the enormous degree of abstraction going on, it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to understand what&amp;rsquo;s happening, and by extension, do anything to customize what&amp;rsquo;s in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Puzzle over what to do for a bit. Decide that websockets might be a better idea, instead of Firebase. You&amp;rsquo;re familiar with them, and you know that you could customize them to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Implement the basics of websockets. Get stuck on how to add A-Frame elements (which it calls &amp;ldquo;entities&amp;rdquo;) to the view when a user hits the page. Spend a few hours being confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 7: Replace A-Frame with &lt;a href=&#34;https://threejs.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;three.js&lt;/a&gt;, in attempt to get rid of some of the abstractions it&amp;rsquo;s making. Manage to render a view that would pop a cube on the screen when someone hit the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 8: Become confused at why, when you opened a second incognito page, the first person/element wasn&amp;rsquo;t present anymore. (Fast forward to step 14.5: it&amp;rsquo;s because you never configured your sockets to do so. Whoops.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 9: Attempt to refactor the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;webvr-boilerplate&lt;/a&gt; so that you could work with it slightly easier. End up breaking a lot of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 10: Complain to a classmate about how terrible VR is. Contemplate starting a different project, although it&amp;rsquo;s 11pm on Friday night and you&amp;rsquo;re presenting on Monday. Create a new GitHub repo for your project. Start customizing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;electron-react-boilerplate&lt;/a&gt; to fit the project you have in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 11: Wake up the next morning, determined once again to conquer VR. Download Unity for the first time. Watch an introductory video going over how to start developing an app for the Google Daydream with Unity. Use Unity to successfully create an app with a floating box and view it on the Daydream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 12: Follow a tutorial made for Google Cardboard to create a social VR app with Unity. Get stuck halfway through. Puzzle why over the person in the tutorial was able to delete his main camera, and you can&amp;rsquo;t, but also why you&amp;rsquo;re not able to switch the camera to the box that represents your avatar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 13: Decide to take another crack at A-Frame. Realize that A-Frame is just an HTML wrapper around a three.js object. Also realize that because of this, you can just append A-Frame entities to the DOM like you would anything else. Feel a tad bit dumb, because you should have realized this a while ago. But also feel wonderful, because this makes your life infinitely easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 14: Bang out half of your app&amp;rsquo;s functionality, including the creation of a user, getting all existing users for the new user, and adding the new user to everyone else&amp;rsquo;s DOM. Get stuck on how to update each user&amp;rsquo;s position on everyone else&amp;rsquo;s view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 15: Have a chat with one of the core contributors to A-Frame. He recommends trying to use the built-in &lt;code&gt;tick&lt;/code&gt; component, which hooks into the browser&amp;rsquo;s native render loop. Attempt to implement this. Sort of succeed, except now a rather important part of your app is failing: a new user who joins isn&amp;rsquo;t able to receive the already-existing users. The already-existing users aren&amp;rsquo;t appearing at all on the new user&amp;rsquo;s DOM. Decide to call it a night and go to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 16: Wake up the next morning, and spend some time at the shelter, walking and playing with dogs. Because dogs make everything better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 17: Continue attempting to figure out what&amp;rsquo;s going wrong and how to fix it. Fail. Intermittently chat with previously mentioned core contributor, who&amp;rsquo;s traveling and on planes and can only talk sparingly and can&amp;rsquo;t really look at your code thoroughly. Fail to come to any meaningful conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 18: Reach out to your fellow who&amp;rsquo;s a socket whiz, because you suspect this may have more to do with sockets than with A-Frame. He says give him a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 19: Eat, because it&amp;rsquo;s 2pm and you haven&amp;rsquo;t eaten yet. Research WebRTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 20: Meet with your fellow. Do A LOT of debugging, gradually getting closer and closer to the issue. Discover the issue was that entities were trying to push updates to new entities, before the new entities were able to load on the new user&amp;rsquo;s DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 21: Implement a somewhat roundabout and possibly non-ideal way to fix this, including creating a variable that switches to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; once the new user has received the existing users, and sending somewhat meaningless socket events back-and-forth between the client and the server. In the process, end up updating the user&amp;rsquo;s position twice for every render loop, which meant that the new user was experiencing some weird spazzy movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 22: Hear from said fellow that A-Frame&amp;rsquo;s built-in WASD controls may not actually update the position. You may have to either programmatically temporarily disable them (for a very quick period of time) in order for the position to be updated, then enabled again after you update the position, or just create your own WASD controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 23: Go grocery shopping. Wait forever in line, because everyone does their grocery shopping on Sunday evenings but you still haven&amp;rsquo;t learned to not go at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 24: Fix your double-updating-position problem. Tentatively try out just updating the user&amp;rsquo;s positions with the normal built-in WASD controls still enabled. REALIZE IT WORKS AND YOU DON&amp;rsquo;T HAVE TO ROLL YOUR OWN WASD CONTROLS!!!!!!!! Successfully broadcast the position of each user to every other user with a slightly hacky &lt;code&gt;setInterval&lt;/code&gt; loop and more somewhat meaningless socket events back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 25: Add rotation tracking. Spend a couple of hours making your scene look pretty with trees and mountains. Create a super basic slideshow to start your presentation with for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 26: Sigh in relief after your presentation. You might not have had time to implement real-time audio, but you accomplished at least your base goal, and that&amp;rsquo;s definitely something to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest lessons I learned from prototyping this app were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimenting is fun. Learning new technologies is fun. But, maybe when you only have five days to pull off a project, you should use something that&amp;rsquo;s above version 0.4.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;VR is hard. Literally no one knows what they&amp;rsquo;re doing. Developing on a platform that was released a month ago makes it enormously harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, before you embark on implementing a new technology, understand the abstractions that it&amp;rsquo;s making. I spent much more time fighting with A-Frame than I did working with it, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand any of the abstractions that it uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the pace of life at Fullstack, we presented our Stackathon projects today, and immediately jumped into our final Capstone project. I was nervous (and still am) about doing another VR project, because this one took a fair bit out of me and I was slightly disillusioned with VR by the end. However, my teammates were excited about building upon what I had done and making this into a fully-fledged &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; (and despite my exhaustion and frustration, I was still very much excited about it as well) — so that&amp;rsquo;s happening! Wish us luck; we&amp;rsquo;ll definitely need it. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the adventure we&amp;rsquo;re about to embark on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub Repo for my project here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bethqiang/transcend&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live demo of my project here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://transcend.herokuapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The demo will probably be more effective if you have two incognito windows open, or recruit a friend to get on at the same time as you. Or, even better, have one person use a WebVR-enabled device, and one use a desktop!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The End of Codsworth Robotics, the Beginning of Stackathon, and a Design Lecture</title>
      <link>http://bethqiang.com/post/codsworth-robotics-stackathon-design-lecture/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We presented &lt;a href=&#34;http://bethqiang.com/post/what-ive-been-up-to-for-4-weeks/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Codsworth Robotics&lt;/a&gt;, your one and only source for robot butlers, today in class. It&amp;rsquo;s officially live &lt;a href=&#34;http://codsworth-robotics.herokuapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and you can view the code &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Codsworth-Robotics/codsworth-robotics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Although it still may be far from a production-ready app, it&amp;rsquo;s basically a fully-functioning e-commerce store, which is pretty impressive, if I do say so myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest moments of my young programming career so far happened on Monday night, when I hooked up the npm package &lt;code&gt;nodemailer&lt;/code&gt; to our checkout process, so that when a user places an order, they&amp;rsquo;ll immediately be sent an email with their confirmation number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://bethqiang.com/images/posts/2017-01/alfred-pennyworth.png&#34; class=&#34;center-img&#34; alt=&#34;Email from Alfred Pennyworth&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My teammates made fun of me a little bit for being so excited about this, and I can&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; articulate why I was, except for that it was just a moment for me when I realized &lt;em&gt;how incredible programming can be&lt;/em&gt;. Which I realize still sounds a little weird, because, at its core, I just sent myself an email. But, a lot of seemingly disparate things came together at that moment for me, I think. (And let&amp;rsquo;s be real, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want an email from Alfred Pennyworth?!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stackathon&#34;&gt;Stackathon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of one project means the beginning of another! Today was the first day of Stackathon, which essentially is a personal hackathon. We have until Monday to build something (anything) of our choosing, and there are a couple of awards on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After internally debating for basically the past month about what I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do, I finally decided to attempt an &lt;a href=&#34;https://altvr.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AltSpace&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://vtime.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;vTime&lt;/a&gt;-like app, but one that could support many more people than those currently do. As Mark Davis, Fullstack&amp;rsquo;s Product Manager, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fullstackacademy.com/blog/vr-lab-jan-2017&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what we wish existed, now: a simple VR environment where up to 25 avatars can interact with each other, with real-time voice chat, that&amp;rsquo;s accessible on a Google Daydream headset as an MVP, but is also extensible to any WebVR enabled headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I only have five days, my primary goals will be to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Render a scene (I&amp;rsquo;m not worried about this part)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate with Firebase to support a lot of people joining (I&amp;rsquo;m more worried about this part), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use WebRTC for real-time audio communication (I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure this part is going to happen, but hey, reach for the stars?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d also love to pitch this to my Capstone Project team after, and build on top of it to create something even more amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve avoided seriously entertaining this idea pretty much since I started thinking about what I wanted to do, because every time I did, I would get overwhelmed and terrified. I&amp;rsquo;m very excited and intrigued by the VR space, but also terrified because of the sheer complexity of designing 3D environments and interactions with those environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite sayings is, &amp;ldquo;If your dreams don&amp;rsquo;t scare you, they&amp;rsquo;re not big enough.&amp;rdquo; I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s pretty applicable now — wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cto-lecture-design&#34;&gt;CTO Lecture: Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Senior Phase, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be having CTO Lectures on a regular basis. These are a series of lectures to expose us to the non-technical parts of building software, including design, scalability, agile, the &amp;ldquo;lean startup&amp;rdquo; methodology, etc. This was one of the parts about the program that I was looking forward to most, and today definitely did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We heard from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/oddurs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Oddur Sigurdsson&lt;/a&gt;, who previously was Creative Director at Fullstack. He worked in the software/design industry for a number of years, and now runs his own company. To become a designer, he argued, there are three steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play. You should be making something. Experiment. Share it with others. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ignore the rules.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan. Set guidelines for yourself. Set a direction (e.g., I want to be there in seven weeks, or two hours). Set goals, and don&amp;rsquo;t stop until you&amp;rsquo;ve achieved them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polish. Iterate and refine. Find the balance between functional and beautiful. Push the limits of your abilities. Get critical feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one of his points was that there are striking similarities between programming and design, and I&amp;rsquo;d argue that these are very applicable to life as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After talking generally about being a designer and the process of design, Oddur pulled out Photoshop and Sketch and demonstrated his workflows and tools for editing photos and creating site/app designs. He spent maybe 20 minutes maximum designing in Sketch, but his design was absolutely gorgeous and I was blown away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I have an extra minute or two (so&amp;hellip;after Fullstack is over?), it&amp;rsquo;s definitely something I would love to delve into further. So much I want to do, so little time. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I&#39;ve Been Up To For The Past 4 Weeks</title>
      <link>http://bethqiang.com/post/what-ive-been-up-to-for-4-weeks/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://bethqiang.com/post/what-ive-been-up-to-for-4-weeks/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m alive, I promise. Mostly. I&amp;rsquo;m just running on very little sleep. Also, can we talk about the fact that this is the first post I get to tag with &amp;ldquo;senior phase&amp;rdquo;?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about everything I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing since the last time I wrote about something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t me accidentally deleting my master branch of my blog. Over winter break, I:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-did, in its entirety, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bethqiang/game-of-life&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Game of Life&lt;/a&gt; using React and Redux. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://bethqiang.com/post/game-of-life-with-react-and-redux/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; the post I wrote about the first half of it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bethqiang/vr-winter-wonderland&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a baby WebVR + three.js app&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a snow scene with falling snow, like five trees, and a stationary penguin that I attempted to animate but would do weird things when I did. Weird penguin aside, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty rad. Also a cool and slightly surreal experience to view it in VR!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched Guardians of the Galaxy for the first time and it was absolutely amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-did our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bethqiang/authentication-data-flow&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Junior Phase workshop on authentication &amp;amp; OAuth&lt;/a&gt;. I felt like I definitely didn&amp;rsquo;t understand a lot of it the first time around, and going back a second time at least made me feel slightly better about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented most of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bethqiang/todo-react-redux-immutable&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a todo app&lt;/a&gt; using React, Redux, and Immutable.js. I used this to also practice some frontend testing. It was thrilling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started and finished most of my tech talk on Immutable Data &amp;amp; Immutable.js.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the past four days, a lot has happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;grace-shopper&#34;&gt;Grace Shopper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the biggest thing that&amp;rsquo;s happened is that we started our Grace Shopper project, an (eventually) fully-functioning e-Commerce store. Our store, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Codsworth-Robotics/codsworth-robotics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Codsworth Robotics&lt;/a&gt;, sells bots to help you with your gardening and cooking and butlering and general life-ing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve personally worked on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up ESLint and configuring it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a few of the database models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing tests for said models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding signup and login features and functions that filter based on authorization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And most recently writing the routes and views for users to view their orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also just spent the last three hours trying and failing to fix a rather small but important thing (rendering the orders view automatically instead of on a click of a button, as it is right now), so this project is currently not on my list of favorite things ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely been challenging trying to figure out what goes where and how all of the pieces fit together. It&amp;rsquo;s our first time creating a fully-fledged app with only a set of requirements and literally &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; else. I 110% believe we&amp;rsquo;re definitely all capable of doing all of it and doing it well, but we&amp;rsquo;re still in some ways getting our bearings straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also been an interesting experience working as part of a team on a longer-term and larger-scale project (instead of just having a pairing partner for a workshop and then getting a different partner the next day). We have three people in our group, and we&amp;rsquo;ve paired all together on some things, and we&amp;rsquo;ve worked completely independently of each other on others, and sometimes one person branches off on their own while the other two pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of who works on what, everyone reviews all pull requests before we agree to merge, and it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not uncommon, if/when we&amp;rsquo;re working individually, for someone to pipe up and say, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m having trouble with this, can I share my screen and get y&amp;rsquo;all&amp;rsquo;s input?&amp;rdquo; Needless to say, I&amp;rsquo;ve also learned more of and become much more comfortable with Git over the past few days! I&amp;rsquo;m still very afraid of merge conflicts and Git yelling at me, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll get used to it eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tech-talk-immutable-data-immutable-js&#34;&gt;Tech Talk: Immutable Data &amp;amp; Immutable.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished my tech talk. I really wanted to incorporate live coding instead of the code snippets at the end, but I was pushing the time limit before I put in the code at all. Next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also presented it today. The good: I didn&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;um&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as much as I typically do when speaking in public. The bad: when I was re-watching myself, I noticed at least two mistakes in my slides, and I think I relied on my notes a little too heavily. But hey, only way to get good at something is to keep doing it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in seeing it, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDf-tpuj8Kw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s already up on Fullstack&amp;rsquo;s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;! The slides can be viewed &lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/bethqiang/immutable-data-and-immutable-dot-js&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stackathon&#34;&gt;Stackathon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another project that all Fullstack seniors do is the Stackathon project. We&amp;rsquo;re given four days to do literally anything we want, and we&amp;rsquo;re encouraged to work alone. (Although if you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to work with another person, no one&amp;rsquo;s going to stop you.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My instructor and I have thrown around some ideas for what I could do. Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m leaning towards either creating a library that I can publish to npm, or an Electron app. (My idea right now for the latter basically amounts to a WYSIWYG editor to write in with an option to convert it to Markdown for static site generators.) I&amp;rsquo;m torn between these because I think writing my own legitimate library would be fun, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get to do any front-end design, which really frustrates me sometimes but it&amp;rsquo;s also something I really enjoy. I keep hearing from people I trust that Electron isn&amp;rsquo;t terribly hard to learn, so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably take a look at it this weekend and see if it would be do-able to do what I want to do in the span of the four days we&amp;rsquo;ll be given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m simultaneously really looking forward to working on this, but also somewhat scared as well. It&amp;rsquo;ll be something I choose and something that excites me, but if given the chance and an excuse, I work &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too much – and that&amp;rsquo;s not in the humble brag &amp;ldquo;I work too hard&amp;rdquo; kinda way. That&amp;rsquo;s an I&amp;rsquo;ll-stay-up-unhealthily-late-(until 5 am late, hello Tuesday night)-working-on-things-because-I-can-and-because-it&amp;rsquo;s-more-fun-than-sleep-and-because-things-not-being-perfect-bother-me kinda way.&lt;/p&gt;
