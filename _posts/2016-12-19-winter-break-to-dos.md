I've accumulated quite the number of to-dos in the past seven weeks. I've attempted to prioritize them slightly, by which I mean I've separated them out into two groups: high priority, and "it would be nice to do these things but I don't think I'll even get to everything on the high priority list, let alone this one." I've listed resources I've found that I might like to use, although they're definitely not hard-and-fast rules – I may not use some at all, and I may use some that I don't even know exist yet. The underlying concepts that I want to learn remain the same, though!

---

### High Priority:

#### Code Wars

* At least two problems every day. To keep the brain sharp, and [to get a free t-shirt]({{ site.url }}/2016/11/07/node-shell-expressjs-and-senior-panel/){:target="_blank"}.

#### Read

* Express source code
* Entirety of React documentation
* At least half of [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X){:target="_blank"}
* [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/){:target="_blank"}

#### Learn About

*Data Structures and Algorithms*

* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms){:target="_blank"}
* Princeton's Algorithms [part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/){:target="_blank"} and [II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-data-structures-algorithms-2){:target="_blank"} and [the accompanying textbook](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/){:target="_blank"}
* [MIT's Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/){:target="_blank"}

I don't think I'll end up doing the entirety of both the Princeton and MIT courses, but I'd like to see if there's one I prefer over the other.

*CSS, Sass, Flexbox, and Design*

* [CodeSchool's CSS](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/css-cross-country){:target="_blank"}
* [CSS: The Missing Manual](https://www.amazon.com/CSS-Missing-David-Sawyer-McFarland/dp/1491918055){:target="_blank"}
* [Pro HTML5 and CSS3 Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/HTML5-Design-Patterns-Experts-Development/dp/1430237805){:target="_blank"}
* [Getting Sassy with CSS](http://www.sassshop.com/#/){:target="_blank"}
* [14 Days to Learn Sass](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/14-days-to-learn-sass){:target="_blank"}
* [CodeSchool's Flexbox](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/cracking-the-case-with-flexbox){:target="_blank"}
* [CodeSchool's Fundamentals of Design](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/fundamentals-of-design){:target="_blank"}
* [CodeSchool's Elements of Web Design](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/the-elements-of-web-design){:target="_blank"}

*Testing*

* [Udacity's Software Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/software-testing--cs258){:target="_blank"}
* Write thorough tests for at least 1 backend and 1 frontend (bonus points if in the same app?)

*Authentication, Authorization, and OAuth*

* At the moment, my only resources will be our class lectures and the accompanying workshop. If I have time, I'll seek out other resources as well.

*Immutable*

* Learn about Immutable.js, how to use it, why you'd want to use it, why you wouldn't want to use it
* Incorporate Immutable.js into an app

#### Tech Talk

* Find topic. Possible ideas thrown around so far: testing in React with Jest and Enzyme, immutable data structures and Immutable.js.
* Research topic.
* Write script.
* Create slides.

(Basically, both start and finish the thing. But listing the steps make it seem a little less daunting...)

#### Projects

* Implement Game of Life with React
* Pupterest, a Pinterest clone, but for puppies, because, puppies
* Contribute to Sequelize docs
* Find-a-coding-group-that-meets-specific-criteria-app
* At least one basic app using three.js/A-Frame/UnityScript/WebVR/ReactVR
* Look into transitioning this blog to [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby){:target="_blank"}, a React static site generator. Or who knows, maybe I'll finally get so annoyed with the writing-in-markdown thing that I convert back to Medium.
* Re-do portfolio section of blog/website
* At least think about what I want to do for my personal and capstone projects coming up in Senior Phase. Also, ideally, get started on said personal project.

#### Writing
* My experiences using WordPress, Medium, and Jekyll for blogging
* My advice to those looking to learn how to code (including fun tips like learn CSS properly, learn Chrome dev tools, how to ask questions, never copy-pasta, etc.). Ideally will publish in Free Code Camp's Medium publication.
* How do I find the bootcamp that's right for me?
* Bootcamp vs. college vs. self-teaching
* Probably many others, including all that I'm learning and doing over break

### Things That Would Be Nice To Do, in no particular order:

* Review all CS Saturday lectures and accompanying exercises. This is quite a lot, but I think they're definitely worth reviewing and really understanding.
* Write tests for Pairboard app
* Learn some basics of [Elm](https://egghead.io/courses/start-using-elm-to-build-web-applications){:target="_blank"}
* Figure out what reactive programming is and why everyone's so excited about it
* Figure out why some people are so excited about static types and at least the general idea of implementation ([related Medium post](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/why-use-static-types-in-javascript-part-1-8382da1e0adb#.4gvm3idvr){:target="_blank"})
* Another Egghead.io course, [*Asynchronous Programming: The End of the Loop*](https://egghead.io/courses/mastering-asynchronous-programming-the-end-of-the-loop){:target="_blank"}
* EdX's How to Code: Systematic Program Design, parts 1-3 ([part 1 here](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-systematic-program-design-part-ubcx-spd1x){:target="_blank"})
* Read [Programming JavaScript Applications](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000262/index.html){:target="_blank"}

*Projects*

* Text-to-markdown converter desktop/web app with Medium-like UI (if desktop app, investigate Electron!)
* Refactor FCC frontend projects, because they're probably a mess of spaghetti code
* [FCC Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.com/){:target="_blank"}

So, now that I've listed this all out...this is going to take much longer than three weeks to accomplish. Probably. Most likely. But hey – shoot for the moon, and you'll at least land among the stars, right?
