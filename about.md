<p>I discovered code through doing statistics and making pretty graphs for my scientific research in college and my job as a data analyst consultant after that. As time went on, I began to realize that I was goot at it, that doing it professionally paid well enough that I wouldn't have a terrible life, and that it challenged and fulfilled me unlike anything I had found prior. I could make the kind of difference in the world that I wanted to with it.</p>

<p>And so, I started teaching myself how to code. I'm currently enrolled in <a href="http://fullstackacademy.com/" target="_blank">Fullstack Academy</a>'s first Remote Immersive cohort, and am loving every second.</p>

<p>Apart from staring at a computer screen, I've run two half marathons, and I'm looking to add a third to the list. I'm an amateur photographer, and take college students' senior pictures and photos and videos of dogs to get them adopted. I love travelling and seeing the world--I've been to the top of a 14,000 foot mountain in the Himalayas, as well as 60 feet below the surface of the Caribbean Sea.</p>

<p>I care deeply about making the world a better place. A few of the causes I support include the anti <a href="http://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/dog-fighting/what-breed-specific-legislation" target="_blank">breed-specific legislation</a> movement and animal shelter reform, protecting the environment, girls and women in tech, and equal access to quality education. My ongoing, lifelong goal is to change the world, and I have no doubt that I'll succeed.
