  <p>I discovered code through doing statistics and making pretty graphs for my scientific research in college and my job as a data analyst consultant after that. As time went on, I began to realize that I was good at it, that doing it professionally paid well enough that I wouldn't have a terrible life, and that it challenged and fulfilled me unlike anything I had found prior. I could make the kind of difference in the world that I wanted to with it.</p>
  <p>And so, I started teaching myself how to code. In the fall of 2016, I joined <a href="https://fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack Academy</a>'s first Remote Immersive cohort, and loved every second. (Okay, sometimes it was more of a love-frustration relationship.)</p>
  <p>When I'm not staring at a computer screen, I've run two half marathons, and I'm looking to add a third to the list. I'm an amateur photographer, and take college students' senior pictures and photos and videos of dogs to get them adopted. I love travelling and seeing the world â€“ I've been to the top of a 14,000 foot mountain in the Himalayas, as well as 60 feet below the surface of the Caribbean Sea.</p>
  <p>I care deeply about making the world a better place. A few of the causes I support include the anti-breed-specific legislation movement and animal shelter reform, protecting the environment, girls and women in tech, equal access to quality education, and political engagement.</p>
