      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m alive, I promise. Mostly. I&amp;rsquo;m just running on very little sleep. Also, can we talk about the fact that this is the first post I get to tag with &amp;ldquo;senior phase&amp;rdquo;?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about everything I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing since the last time I wrote about something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t me accidentally deleting my master branch of my blog. Over winter break, I:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-did, in its entirety, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bethqiang/game-of-life&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Game of Life&lt;/a&gt; using React and Redux. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://bethqiang.com/post/game-of-life-with-react-and-redux/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; the post I wrote about the first half of it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bethqiang/vr-winter-wonderland&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a baby WebVR + three.js app&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a snow scene with falling snow, like five trees, and a stationary penguin that I attempted to animate but would do weird things when I did. Weird penguin aside, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty rad. Also a cool and slightly surreal experience to view it in VR!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched Guardians of the Galaxy for the first time and it was absolutely amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-did our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bethqiang/authentication-data-flow&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Junior Phase workshop on authentication &amp;amp; OAuth&lt;/a&gt;. I felt like I definitely didn&amp;rsquo;t understand a lot of it the first time around, and going back a second time at least made me feel slightly better about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented most of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bethqiang/todo-react-redux-immutable&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a todo app&lt;/a&gt; using React, Redux, and Immutable.js. I used this to also practice some frontend testing. It was thrilling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started and finished most of my tech talk on Immutable Data &amp;amp; Immutable.js.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the past four days, a lot has happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;grace-shopper&#34;&gt;Grace Shopper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the biggest thing that&amp;rsquo;s happened is that we started our Grace Shopper project, an (eventually) fully-functioning e-Commerce store. Our store, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bethqiang/codsworth-robotics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Codsworth Robotics&lt;/a&gt;, sells bots to help you with your gardening and cooking and butlering and general life-ing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve personally worked on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up ESLint and configuring it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a few of the database models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing tests for said models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding signup and login features and functions that filter based on authorization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And most recently writing the routes and views for users to view their orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also just spent the last three hours trying and failing to fix a rather small but important thing (rendering the orders view automatically instead of on a click of a button, as it is right now), so this project is currently not on my list of favorite things ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely been challenging trying to figure out what goes where and how all of the pieces fit together. It&amp;rsquo;s our first time creating a fully-fledged app with only a set of requirements and literally &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; else. I 110% believe we&amp;rsquo;re definitely all capable of doing all of it and doing it well, but we&amp;rsquo;re still in some ways getting our bearings straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also been an interesting experience working as part of a team on a longer-term and larger-scale project (instead of just having a pairing partner for a workshop and then getting a different partner the next day). We have three people in our group, and we&amp;rsquo;ve paired all together on some things, and we&amp;rsquo;ve worked completely independently of each other on others, and sometimes one person branches off on their own while the other two pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of who works on what, everyone reviews all pull requests before we agree to merge, and it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not uncommon, if/when we&amp;rsquo;re working individually, for someone to pipe up and say, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m having trouble with this, can I share my screen and get y&amp;rsquo;all&amp;rsquo;s input?&amp;rdquo; Needless to say, I&amp;rsquo;ve also learned more of and become much more comfortable with Git over the past few days! I&amp;rsquo;m still very afraid of merge conflicts and Git yelling at me, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll get used to it eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tech-talk-immutable-data-immutable-js&#34;&gt;Tech Talk: Immutable Data &amp;amp; Immutable.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished my tech talk. I really wanted to incorporate live coding instead of the code snippets at the end, but I was pushing the time limit before I put in the code at all. Next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also presented it today. The good: I didn&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;um&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as much as I typically do when speaking in public. The bad: when I was re-watching myself, I noticed at least two mistakes in my slides, and I think I relied on my notes a little too heavily. But hey, only way to get good at something is to keep doing it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in seeing it, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDf-tpuj8Kw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s already up on Fullstack&amp;rsquo;s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;! The slides can be viewed &lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/bethqiang/immutable-data-and-immutable-dot-js&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stackathon&#34;&gt;Stackathon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another project that all Fullstack seniors do is the Stackathon project. We&amp;rsquo;re given four days to do literally anything we want, and we&amp;rsquo;re encouraged to work alone. (Although if you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to work with another person, no one&amp;rsquo;s going to stop you.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My instructor and I have thrown around some ideas for what I could do. Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m leaning towards either creating a library that I can publish to npm, or an Electron app. (My idea right now for the latter basically amounts to a WYSIWYG editor to write in with an option to convert it to Markdown for static site generators.) I&amp;rsquo;m torn between these because I think writing my own legitimate library would be fun, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get to do any front-end design, which really frustrates me sometimes but it&amp;rsquo;s also something I really enjoy. I keep hearing from people I trust that Electron isn&amp;rsquo;t terribly hard to learn, so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably take a look at it this weekend and see if it would be do-able to do what I want to do in the span of the four days we&amp;rsquo;ll be given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m simultaneously really looking forward to working on this, but also somewhat scared as well. It&amp;rsquo;ll be something I choose and something that excites me, but if given the chance and an excuse, I work &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too much – and that&amp;rsquo;s not in the humble brag &amp;ldquo;I work too hard&amp;rdquo; kinda way. That&amp;rsquo;s an I&amp;rsquo;ll-stay-up-unhealthily-late-(until 5 am late, hello Tuesday night)-working-on-things-because-I-can-and-because-it&amp;rsquo;s-more-fun-than-sleep-and-because-things-not-being-perfect-bother-me kinda way.&lt;/p&gt;
