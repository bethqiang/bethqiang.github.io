Well, folks. Fullstack's officially over. (In fairness, it's been over for almost a week now, and I just haven't quite gotten around to writing about it.)

It's...weird. You do this thing for 60+ hours a week for almost five months straight, and you see the same 15 other faces in little squares on your computer every day. And then you drink some wine and sit around with your classmates for a few hours and then on Monday you wake up and realize that you have all the time in the world. (And simultaneously somehow, no time at all.)

I've waxed poetic and sentimental about my experience at Fullstack [many times before](http://bethqiang.com/tags/fullstack-reflections/), so I'll follow the principle of DRY and briefly just reiterate that my cohort was amazing, the instructors and fellows and staff and David and Nimit (the co-founders) are amazing, the curriculum was hard and rigorous and challenging and I sometimes wanted to cry but it was also amazing. The project phase definitely had its ups and downs, but I was able to work with some incredible developers, and produce what I'm pretty sure is the world's first [browser-based VR classroom](http://bethqiang.com/tags/capstone-project/).

Basically, everything was amazing! Which sounds disingenuous, but everything was legitimately incredible. I was a little nervous about joining the first Remote Immersive cohort (it's always scary being the first!), but having come out on the other side, I can most definitely say it is and will always be one of the best decisions I've ever made. I've made lifelong friends and mentors, I learned an incredible amount, and I definitely grew as a developer, a teammate, and a person.

## Some of the More Abstract Takeaways

We learned a lot about software engineering. We learned all about [JavaScript, Node, Express, jQuery, React, and Redux]({{< ref "blog/fullstack-academy-junior-phase-in-review.md" >}}). In our [Grace Shopper](http://bethqiang.com/tags/fullstack-reflections/) project, we learned how to work with a team, how to use Git, and how to create something substantial from end-to-end. During our final [Capstone project](http://bethqiang.com/tags/capstone-project/), we learned about WebRTC and race conditions and using the entity-component-system and how to use a technology that's on version 0.4.0.

But beyond the technical details, I've also learned:

1. Programming is about so much more than the code. It's about the people that you're working with, and the people whose lives could be affected by your code. The code may be a way to accomplish something, but in the end, your goal should always be help the people who will be working with it and using it.

2. On a similar vein, connecting with people is one of the most important things you can do. One of my favorite moments from the program was a Friday afternoon towards the end of Capstone, when we were all a little antsy and tired and overwhelmed, and we decided to have our own team happy hour. We grabbed our respective drinks, and sort of did work but mostly talked about our lives and our hopes and our dreams and our view on politics and controversial issues. As a cohort, we also had a few spontaneous late-night conversations after the day was done, and I always enjoyed those thoroughly.

3. Positive feedback is extremely important. When I gave code reviews, I had a habit of glossing over the positives, even though I thought them in my head, and focused instead on what I thought could be improved. When people spend hours grinding away at something and then are courageous enough to show the world (or at least, the other people working on the project), it can be a very vulnerable thing for them. Make those people feel welcomed, and valued, and point out the good things they did, *along with* the things that you think could be improved.

4. Create a great environment and a great program, and people will come, and they will want to stay. David and Nimit, by virtue of who they are and their efforts, have created something very special. Fullstack is one of the most inclusive, friendly, supportive, and fun environments I've ever been in, and in light of the tech industry's ongoing issues with diversity and inclusiveness, that's always an amazing thing to find and to be able to come back to.

## So...what's next?

I'm officially on the job hunt! My primary focus will be in the Austin area, but I'm definitely not opposed to moving for the right opportunity. If you know anyone looking for junior devs, I'd love to chat! And if you don't have or know someone who has jobs, but have advice that you want to offer, I'm all ears. :)

More importantly, I have a few fun things in the pipeline:

* A few personal projects — first up will probably be a rich-text-with-spell-check-to-markdown app that I was considering doing for my Fullstack hackathon project, but decided not to. More details TBD. I also really want to finally actually learn Elm and C#/Unity (I know, those are two very different things)...but the whole 24-hours-in-a-day thing is inconvenient.

* I'd like to get more involved in an organization like [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/) or [Tech for Campaigns](https://www.techforcampaigns.org/) or something where I can use my technical skills to enable civic engagement. I still need to do slightly more research and see how I want to proceed with this, but it's most definitely a prominent part of my agenda.

* Continuing to be a part of Women Who Code, giving talks, and mentoring women who are just getting their feet into the coding waters. Come join me at a Women Who Code event around Austin! I'm also in the process of expanding my meetup scene a bit, so if you have suggestions, I'd be happy to hear them! I'm not looking for anything in particular; mostly just an easy-going community who likes to geek out about code.

* I've signed on to help a classmate, [Rachel](http://rachelbird.com/), with a project she started at Fullstack that she's now turning into a legitimate non-profit. It's called [Working Women Advocates](http://workingwomenadvocates.org/). We hope it'll serve as a place for women to find and connect with advocates and allies to help them through being a woman in the workplace, whether they're actively facing challenges like discrimination or harassment, or they just need a woman's ear to vent to. While doing research for this project, Rachel was suprised to find out that nothing like this really existed — so here we are! I'll be focused primarily on the dev/tech side, and we have other people who are better than me at other things to do those other things, but we're definitely still looking for more help. Come check us out, and let us know if you're interested in offering your skills or a small donation! (We're in the process of setting up a legitimate non-profit, but unfortunately we can't offer tax-deductible donations at the time!) We've received a lot of positive feedback so far, as well as a lot of interest in helping us, and we'd love for you to be a part of it!
