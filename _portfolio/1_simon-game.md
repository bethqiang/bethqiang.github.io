<p>Play a game of Simon.</p>

<p>Built using HTML, CSS, <a href="http://materializecss.com/" target="_blank">the Materialize framework</a>, JavaScript, and JQuery.</p>

<p>Current functionalities include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A sound and "light up" animation that corresponds to each button plays both when the series of button presses plays, and when the player personally presses a button.</li>
	<li>Play on normal mode, where if a wrong button is pressed, the game will let the player know, will play the series of button presses again, and will let the player try again.</li>
	<li>Play on strict mode, where if a wrong button is pressed, the game ends.</li>
	<li>Win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct.</li>
</ul>
