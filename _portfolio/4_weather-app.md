<p>A web app that allows you to view the current weather and the 3-day forecast based on your current location.</p>

<p>Built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, <a href="https://darksky.net/dev/" target="_blank">the Dark Sky API</a>, and <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro" target="_blank">the Google Maps Geocoding API</a>.</p>

<p>Current functionalities include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Automatically detect location by city and state.</li>
	<li>View the current and "feels like" temperature.</li>
	<li>View the current conditions, with an icon that changes depending on the conditions.</li>
	<li>View a 3-day forecast with conditions and chance of rain. If between 12am and 6am, the first day in the forecast will be that current day.</li>
	<li>Change units of all temperatures by toggling between Fahrenheit and Celsius.</li>
</ul>

<p>Future ideas include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>View current day and time.</li>
	<li>Include chance of high and low, chance of rain, and wind speed at current time.</li>
	<li>Search for the weather at any location in the world.</li>
	<li>View hour-by-hour (or every-3-hours?) temperatures and chances of rain.</li>
</ul>
