  <p>I discovered the coding world through statistics and creating pretty graphs for my research in college. Afterwards, I started working as a data analytics consultant and learned R, SQL, and SAS. As time went on, I began to realize that coding challenged and fulfilled me unlike anything I had found prior, and that I could make the kind of difference in the world that I wanted to with it.</p>

  <p>And so, I started teaching myself how to code. After learning on my own with the aid of Free Code Camp, I joined <a href="https://fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack Academy</a>'s first Remote Immersive cohort in the fall of 2016, and loved every second. (Okay, sometimes it was more of a love/frustration-bordering-on-hate relationship, but it was mostly love.)</p>

  <p>Outside of sitting in front of a code editor and StackOverflow, I've run two half marathons, and I'm looking to add a third to the list. I'm heavily involved in my local animal shelter, where I train, run with, photograph and video, and cuddle with dogs. I also train new volunteers to handle the dogs. I love travelling and seeing the world â€“ I've been to the top of a 14,000 foot mountain in the Himalayas, as well as 60 feet below the surface of the Caribbean Sea.</p>

  <p>I care deeply about making the world a better place. A few of the causes I support include the anti-breed-specific legislation movement and animal shelter reform, protecting the environment, girls and women in tech, equal access to quality education, and civic engagement.</p>
